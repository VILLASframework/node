	   we want to push Plugins to the list from within each Plugin's constructor
	   that is executed during static initialization. Since the order of static
	   initialization is undefined in C++, it may happen that a Plugin
	   constructor is executed before the list could be initialized. Therefore,
	   we use the Nifty Counter Idiom [1] to initialize the list ourself before
	   the first usage.

		In short:
		- allocate a buffer for the list
		- initialize list before first usage
		- (complicatedly) declaring a buffer is neccessary in order to avoid
		  that the constructor of the static list is executed again
