/** This is an example for a minimal loopback configuration.
 *
 * All messages will be sent back to the origin using UDP packets.
 *
 * You can use this configuration in conjunction with the 'send', 'receive' and 'random'
 * utilities as shown below (run all three steps in parallel).
 *
 * 0. Overview:
 *
 *    villas signal --PIPE--> ./pipe  --UDP--> ./node --UDP--> ./pipe
 *
 * 1. Start server:
 *
 *    $ villas node etc/loopback.conf
 *
 * 2. Send random data to server:
 *
 *    $ villas signal random -r 10 -v 4 | villas pipe etc/loopback.conf node1
 *
 * 3. Receive data from server:
 *
 *    $ villas pipe etc/loopback.conf node2
 *
 * The syntax of this file is similar to JSON.
 * A detailed description of the format can be found here:
 *   http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html#Configuration-Files
