/** Example configuration file for VILLASnode.
 *
 * This example includes all valid configuration options for the server.
 * Please note, that using all options at the same time does not really
 * makes sense. The purpose of this example is to serve as a reference.
 *
 * The syntax of this file is similar to JSON.
 * A detailed description of the format can be found here:
