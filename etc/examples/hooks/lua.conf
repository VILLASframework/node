				#                   the full hook configuration
				#   start()         Called when the node/path is started
				#
				#   stop()          Called when the node/path is stopped
				#
				#   restart()       Called when the node/path is restarted.
				#                   Falls back to stop() + start() if absent.
				#
				#   process(smp)    Called for each sample which is being processed.
				#                   The sample is passed as a Lua table with the following
				#                   fields:
				#                      - sequence     The sequence number of the sample.
				#                      - flags        The flags field of the sample.
				#                      - ts_origin    The origin timestamp as a Lua table containing
				#                                     the following keys:
