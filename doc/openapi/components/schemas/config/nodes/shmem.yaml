      description: |
        If set to `pthread`, POSIX condition variables (CV) are used to signal writes between processes.
        If set to `polling`, no CV's are used, meaning that blocking writes have to be implemented using polling, leading to performance improvements at a cost of unnecessary CPU usage.

    exec:
      description: |
        Optional name and command-line arguments (as passed to `execve`) of a command to be executed during node startup.
        This can be used to start the external program directly from VILLASNode. If unset, no command is executed.
