    prefix:
      type: string
      description: A prefix which is prepended to the output file name of the RTT test result file.
      example: "test_1"

    output:
      type: string
      default: "."
      description: A directory path at which the RTT test result files be placed.

    cooldown:
      type: number

      description: |
        A cool-down time between consecutive test cases.
        The node will insert a pause between the tests to avoid any network effects of the previous test-case to influence the upcoming test-case.

    cases:
      type: object
      description: |
        A list of test-case specifications.

        The values from the `rates` and `values` settings of each-test case specification will be used to form a cross-product.
      properties:
        rates:
          description: |
            A list of sending rates in Hz.
            The resulting test-case will generate samples at the given rate.
          example:
          - 10
          - 100
          - 1000
          - 10000
          type: array

            type: number

        values:
          description: |
            A list of sample length.
            The resulting test-case will generate samples with the given number of signals.
          type: array

            type: integer
          example:
          - 10
          - 100

          description: |
            The resulting test-case will send the number of samples specified by this setting.
            This setting is exclusive with the `duration` setting.
          type: integer
          example: 10000

        duration:
          description: |
            The resulting test-case will be stopped after the configured duration in seconds.
            This setting is exclusive with the `limit` setting.
          type: number
          example: 60.0
