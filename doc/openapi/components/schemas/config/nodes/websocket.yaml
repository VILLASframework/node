        Each URI must use the following scheme:

        ```
        protocol://host:port/nodename
        ```

        It starts with a protocol which must be one of `ws` (unencrypted) or `wss` (SSL).
        The host name or IP address is separated by `://`.
        The optional port number is separated by a colon `:`.
        The node name is separated by a slash `/`.
