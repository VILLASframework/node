    description: Timestamp of measurement in ISO 8601 format
    type: string
    pattern: '^\d{4}(-\d\d(-\d\d(T\d\d:\d\d(:\d\d)?(\.\d+)?(([+-]\d\d:\d\d)|Z)?)?)?)?$'

    description: ID (uuid) from CIM document
    type: string
    format: uuid
  
  measurand:
    type: string
    enum:
    - voltmagnitude
    - voltangle
    - currmagnitude
    - currangle
    - activepower
    - reactivepower
    - apparentpower

  data:
    type: number
    description: |
      Measurement value as in the following format depending on value of measurand:
       - voltmagnitude: phase-to-ground RMS value, unit volts
       - voltangle: unit radian
       - currmagnitude: RMS value, unit ampere
       - currangle: unit radian
       - activepower: single phase power, unit watts
       - reactivepower: single phase power, unit voltampere reactive
       - apparentpower: single phase power, unit voltampere
       - frequency: unit hertz 

example:
  device: pmu-abc0
  timestamp: '2021-10-07T10:11:12.1231241+02:00'
