# This is an example for a minimal loopback configuration.
#
# All messages will be sent back to the origin using UDP packets.
#
# You can use this configuration in conjunction with the 'send', 'receive' and 'random'
# utilities as shown below (run all three steps in parallel).
#
# 0. Overview:
#
#    ./random --PIPE--> ./send  --UDP--> ./server --UDP--> ./receive
#
# 1. Start server:
#
#    $ ./server etc/loopback.conf
#
# 2. Send random data to server:
#
#    $ ./random 4 10 | ./send etc/loopback.conf node1 -r
#
# 3. Receive data from server:
#
#    $ ./receive etc/loopback.conf node2 -r
