	abstract = {The Global Real-Time Superlaboratory (Global {RT} Superlab) represents a vendor-neutral distributed platform based on the virtual interconnection of digital real-time simulators ({DRTSs}) and hardware-in-the-loop ({HIL}) setups hosted at eight geographically distributed laboratories in the United States and Europe (Figure 1). This article describes the efforts toward the realization of this largescale virtual infrastructure and explains a demonstration of the multilab setup for simulation and testing of next-generation global power grids.},
