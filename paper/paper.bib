	abstract = {As both the generation resources and load types have changed and grown over the past few decades, there is a growing need for analysis that spans traditional simulation boundaries; for example, evaluating the impact of distribution-level assets (e.g. rooftop solar, {EV} chargers) on bulk-power system operation. Co-simulation is a technique that allows simulators to trade information during run-time, effectively creating larger and more complex models. {HELICS} is a co-simulation platform that has been developed to enable these kinds of power system analysis, incorporating tools from a variety of domains including the electrical power grid, natural gas, transportation, and communications. This paper summarizes the technical design of {HELICS}, describes how tools can be integrated into the platform, and reviews a number of analyses that have been performed using {HELICS}.

	abstract = {Smart Grids rely on the use of {ICT} for managing large numbers of active components and sensors to keep demand and generation of electricity at equilibrium while operating multiple resources within their operational limits. Due to the distributed nature of these resources, their heterogeneity as well as their sheer number, is a challenging task. Control strategies as well as novel paradigms need to be developed and thoroughly evaluated through extensive simulations. In order to yield scientifically sound and reliable results, these simulations have to rely on valid and (ideally) established models, e.g., from industry. Therefore, it is desirable to reuse these models as often as possible by combining them into new, potentially large-scale test scenarios. The introduced mosaik framework presents a flexible architecture as well as a powerful modeling and specification language to automate the process of composing existing models and simulation platforms into large-scale simulation scenarios.},
