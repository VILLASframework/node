This is VILLASnode, a gateway for processing and forwardning simulation data between real-time simulators.
VILLASnode is a client/server application to connect simulation equipment and software such as:

 - OPAL-RT eMegaSim,
 - RTDS GTFPGA cards,
 - Simulink,
 - LabView,
 - and FPGA models.

It's designed with a focus on very low latency to achieve almost realtime exchange of simulation data.
VILLASnode is used in distributed- and co-simulation scenarios and developed for the field of power grid simulation at the EON Energy Research Center in Aachen, Germany.
